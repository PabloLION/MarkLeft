## Description
Replace the current simplistic regex-based markdown parser with a proper token/AST-based markdown parser library to enable robust rendering of complex markdown features.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in `src/ui/webview.ts` uses basic regex replacements:
```typescript
// src/ui/webview.ts:140-147
// This is a very basic implementation - will be enhanced with proper markdown parser
```

## Proposed Solution
Implement a proper markdown parser using `markdown-it` (already added as dependency) or similar library that provides:
- Token-based parsing
- AST generation
- Plugin support for extensions
- Better handling of edge cases
- Support for code blocks and mermaid graphs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace regex-based parsing with markdown-it or similar
- [ ] Support all standard markdown features
- [ ] Maintain selective editing capability
- [ ] Support custom renderers for special elements (tables, math, diagrams)
- [ ] Ensure performance remains acceptable for large documents
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for markdown parsing

## Technical Considerations
- The parser must integrate with the selective editing mode
- Code blocks and mermaid diagrams depend heavily on proper parsing
- Consider using markdown-it plugins for extended features
- Ensure compatibility with existing LaTeX and wiki-link features

## Dependencies
- markdown-it (already in package.json)
- Potentially markdown-it plugins for specific features

## Priority
Medium - The basic implementation works but will limit advanced features

## Effort Estimate
Medium (2-3 days)
